## 🎯 What This Does

This creates a **PiNet URL** - a special address within Pi Network's ecosystem where users can access your app directly from Pi's interface.

```
Two Ways to Access Your App:

1. Vercel Domain (Direct URL):
   https://pipulse-five.vercel.app
   └─ For sharing with anyone, anytime

2. PiNet Domain (Inside Pi Network):
   pipulse-XXXX.pinet.pi
   └─ For access through Pi Network's app ecosystem
```

Both work! Users can choose either.

## 🔤 Rules to Remember

- Numbers: 0-9
- Hyphens: `-` (to separate words)

### ❌ Don't Use:
- Uppercase letters
- Underscores `_`
- Spaces
- Special characters (except hyphens)
